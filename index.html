                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a PhD candidate at the University of Hong Kong. My research focuses on the social values of
                    finance, specifically how financial mechanisms can address gender inequality and contribute to
                    climate change solutions. My job market paper explores the impact of bank competition on women's
                    access to credit. Another line of my work investigates how people's experiences shape their beliefs
                    and behaviors regarding environmental issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to my research, I am passionate about teaching and thrive on engaging with students in the classroom. I love the opportunity to enhance
                    financial literacy and share fascinating economic insights with diverse audiences.

            Abstract: We examine the impact of increased bank competition on credit access for female-led small
            businesses. Exploiting the 2005 branching reform in India and a regression discontinuity
            design, we find that increased bank competition significantly improves credit access for female-
            led firms, with the probability of borrowing increasing by 6% and loan amounts by 27%.
            However, such effects are absent for male-led firms. Consistent with Becker's (1957) theory of
            discrimination, the effect is more pronounced in areas with discriminatory norms and branches
            with a higher proportion of male staff. The reform also boosted female entrepreneurship,
            indicating an improvement in women's economic status.
